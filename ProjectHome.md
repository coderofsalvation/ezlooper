# what is it? #
EZ Looper is an application build for dj's and livemusicians, originally intended to control it with the MIDIMAN DM2 controller (still works).
Its build in 100% pure C++.
Basically its just a djplayer with :

```
- controllable by keyboard or a midicontroller 
- loopregions inside can be triggered (uses WAV markers) (beta).
- internal VST effects : lowpass/highpass filter + 2x dubdelay
- plays mp3/wav files
- jog/pitch tracks like any other cdplayer in the clubscene.
- GIF as background, so you can style the app to your own taste
```

# Why another djplayer? #
First of all, I wasn't satisfied with the software which came with my mixman dm2 controller.
When a producer/dj designs his liveset, sometimes sticking with minimalistic stuff can make things more pleasant. After trying zillions of dj-players, I concluded that
it was better to redirect this energy towards building a minimalistic player.
I wanted to create a simple loop tool, but it evolved into this since the looppoints arent really stable.

# Focus #
The main focus is that you should be able to dj with your eyes closed.
A lot of djplayers/sequencers have complex interfaces with tiny fonts, dangerous complex MIDI-options.
The workflow should be : get on stage,start your laptop+program, close your laptop and party!

Chances for updates are very rare since I kind of abanded the idea which started this app.
