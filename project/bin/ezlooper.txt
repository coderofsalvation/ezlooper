::::::  function: very minimalistic live looptool aimed for speed & midi

[what is it?]
The EZ Looper System is a application build for dj's and livemusicians, aimed
to control it with the MIDIMAN DM2 controller.
Basically its just a djplayer with some nice loopfunctions & MIDI-support.
It can play mp3/wav files just like any other cdplayer in the clubscene.
Also, loopregions can be triggered so tracks can go beyond its linear character.
All this can be controlled by just a simple PC keyboard or a midicontroller 
(Preferred is the MIDIMAN DM2 together with P.Doom's DM2MIDI tool because that's
how this app started).

[Why?...why would you make ANOTHER djplayer ?]
When a producer/dj designs his liveset, sometimes sticking with minimalistic stuff
can make things more pleasant. After trying zillions of dj-players, I concluded that
it was better to redirect this energy towards building a minimalistic player.

[Ok...but what is the focus of this djplayer?]
The main focus is that you should be able to get drunk, and still be able to do an
incredible liveset. There is no user interface, because that shifted to the DM2 midi controller.
A lot of djplayers/sequencers have complex interfaces with tiny fonts, dangerous 
complex MIDI-options, while the performance should be main focus and not all kinda 
technical satisfact-your-ego-features.
The workflow should be : get on stage,start your laptop+program, close your laptop and party!

[Troubleshooting]
- try to delete the 'ezloopaz.cfg'. Because that's where all the soundcard/midi settings are stored.
